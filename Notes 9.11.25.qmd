## Notes from Class

Always a good idea to load packages we need up front, and in a seperate code chunck so we can mess with the setting afterwords.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

```

So far so good

ggplot is designed to work in data that is in a "tidy format"

will start wirh data that is already in a tidy format.

```{r}
mpg
```

mpg

(most data comes in an object type dataframe

Cars (typical R dataset) compare with "tidy" data in

```{r}
ca
```

```{r}
View(mpg)

```
